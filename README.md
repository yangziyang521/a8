# a8 - 2048 Game

Welcome to the 2048 Game!

Upon running, you will be brought directly to the game.

Through using the up, down, left and right buttons on your keyboard, you will be able to control the movements of the blocks.

Initially there will be 2 blocks, both have the number of 2.

With every move you make, there will be a new block of number 2 popping up at a random spot in the 4x4 grid panel.

Whenever two blocks with the same number encounter ( this basically means that your command leads them to merge with each other), they will merge into one cell and the number of it will change to the sum of the previous two numbers.

So basically your number will go like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 and finally, 2048.

You will win the game if you make it to 2048!

You will lose the game if there is no longer any empty spot on the grid panel. But never mind, try again!

Are you ready for trying it out? Go ahead and have fun!
